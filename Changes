Revision history for Moo

  - drop dependency on Test::Fatal

2.005004 - 2021-03-29
  - fix file set in %INC in create_class_with_roles (RT#134845)

2.005003 - 2021-03-21
  - silence 'once' warnings from Moo::_Utils

2.005_002 - 2021-01-22
  - fix C3 test skipping properly when MRO::Compat not available on perl < 5.10

2.005_001 - 2021-01-20
  - fix perl version check in global destruction code

2.005_000 - 2021-01-20
  - remove MooseX::Types from developer prereqs
  - recommend Sub::Util rather than Sub::Name, since Sub::Util is in core
  - fix line numbers when using oo module (perl -Moo)
  - adjust some author tests to rely less on external modules
  - lower Exporter prereq to any version
  - bump Role::Tiny prereq to 2.003004
  - refactor and simplify role application code, as allowed by new Role::Tiny
    version
  - switch to using normal strict+warnings rather than strictures for authors
  - remove strictures from recommends, as Moo does not use it anywhere
  - remove Task::Weaken prereq, as it served no purpose
  - remove MRO::Compat prereq, using it only when user code does
  - remove use of Devel::GlobalDestruction in code, only using
    Devel::GlobalDestruction::XS when it is available. Devel::GlobalDestruction
    is still a dependency on perl < 5.14 to facilitate the installation of the
    ::XS module.
  - Moo now has no mandatory perl version specific dependencies. The version
    specific modules are now optional or not used. This means code using Moo can
    be fatpacked on a new perl version without special cases, and it will work
    on older perl versions.

2.004004 - 2020-11-25
  - fix error location test when using core Carp on perl 5.8.9 - 5.10.1

    (RT#115655)
  - prevent infinite recursion on some Moose metaclass inflation errors.

  - prevent local functions with same names as core functions from interfering
    with generated code (RT#115529)

    (RT#115518)
  - Fix tests to work when lexical features are enabled outside of our control
    (such as with cperl)
  - Fix tests on perl 5.6

2.002002 - 2016-06-21
  - fix handling of Carp < 1.12

2.002_001 - 2016-06-17
  - added Sub::Quote::sanitize_identifier to generate an identifier from an
    arbitrary string.
  - Sub::Defer::defer_info is now exportable.
  - improved documentation for Sub::Quote.
  - fix quoted subs with no_defer ignoring no_install option. (RT#114605)
  - internals of Sub::Quote were refactored.
  - error message when @ISA changes now includes the location that the
    constructor was generated.
  - original invoker will be used when calling a non-Moo parent constructor.
    (RT#115189)
  - added testing for preserving context into quote_sub subs. (RT#114511)

  - Sub::Quote::quote_sub gained attributes option to specify sub attributes.

2.002_000 - 2016-05-18
  - Use Carp::croak rather than die to improve reported error locations
    (RT#109844, RT#109632, RT#102622)
  - removed Method::Inliner module.  It was never intended to ship with Moo,
    and was undocumented, untested, and unused on CPAN.
  - require Role::Tiny 2.000002 for fixes to method modifiers being applied
    via multiple role composition paths (RT#106668)
  - Delay loading Class::Method::Modifiers until we actually need it
  - Fix an explosion that could happen if meta inflation was attempted part way
    through Moo's bootstrapping process, which was possible via a
    CORE::GLOBAL::bless override (RT#113743)
  - Accessor subs will be generated immediately, rather than being partially
    deferred.  The deferal added extra sub layers and the delayed compilation
    didn't provide any real benefit for them.
  - Numeric values used as defaults will be inlined as numbers rather than
    strings.
  - Numerous test cleanups and additional test coverage
  - Fixed a typo in Sub::Defer docs (RT#113416)
  - Deferred subs (including constructors) will always be named properly, even
    if neither Sub::Name nor Sub::Util are available.  This improves
    compatibility with namespace::autoclean, among other things.  Once the sub
    is undeferred, it may not be given a correct name if Sub::Name or Sub::Util
    aren't available.

2.001001 - 2016-03-04
  - Fixed order of attribute value being set and trigger running when there is
    an isa check present. (RT#112677)
  - Corrected LIFECYCLE METHODS to be a head1 section rather than head2.

2.001000 - 2016-02-29
  * Documentation
    - Added documentation for has's ability to accept an arrayref of attribute
      names to create with the same options.
    - Removed mention that we may not call BUILDARGS, since that behavior was
      removed in 2.000002.
    - Reorganized documentation of class methods to separate those provided as a
      public API (new/does/meta) from those used by Moo in the object lifecycle
      (BUILDARGS/FOREIGNBUILDARGS/BUILD/DEMOLISH).
    - Updated documentation of most class methods for clarity.
    - Updated BUILDARGS documentation to show an around rather than just
      overriding.
    - Added examples to FOREIGNBUILDARGS and BUILD.
    - Added explicit documentation for DOES and meta methods.

  * Fixes
    - Fixed grammar in error message when @ISA is changed unexpectedly before
      a constructor is fully generated.
    - Fixed Moo classes and Sub::Quote subs in packages that are nearly 252
      characters long.
    - Fixed Sub::Defer::undefer_package emitting warnings.
    - Fixed detection of constructors that have already been inlined.

  * Performance
    - The generated code in constructors and setters has had a number of
      microoptimizations applied.
    - Deferred subs (and quoted subs like some accessors) in roles will be
      undefered before copying them to classes.  This prevents the need for a
      goto on every call that would slow down the subs.
    - Fixed Moose inflation code resulting in constructors with deferred
      wrappers.

  * Other
    - Recommend Sub::Name 0.08, which fixes a memory leak.
    - The values given to BUILD subs will be the original values passed to new,
      rather than after coercions have been applied.  This brings the behavior
      in line with Moose.

2.000002 - 2015-07-24
  - BUILDARGS will now always be called on object creation, even if no
    attributes exist
  - fix required attributes with spaces or other odd characters in init_arg
  - fix (is => 'lazy', required => 1, init_arg => undef), which previously
    didn't think it provided a builder
  - under 'no Moo::sification', prevent automatic Moose metaclass inflation
    from ->meta calls
  - don't load Moo::Role for a ->does check if no roles could exist
  - make global destruction test more robust from outside interference
  - fix false default values satisfying required attributes
  - Fix Moose attribute delegation to a Moo class via a wildcard
  - work around case where Sub::Util is loadable but doesn't provide
    Sub::Util::set_subname
  - skip thread tests on perl 5.8.4 and below where threads are extremely
    unreliable
  - Allow stub methods (e.g. sub foo;) to be overwritten by accessors or other
    generated methods. (RT#103804)

2.000001 - 2015-03-16
  - Fix how we pick between Sub::Name and Sub::Util if they are both loaded.
    This fixes how we interact with Moose in some cases. (RT#102729) (GH#15)

2.000000 - 2015-03-02
  * Incompatible Changes
    - Fatal warnings and the other additional checks from the strictures
      module will no longer be applied to modules using Moo or Moo::Role.  We
      now only apply strict and (non-fatal) warnings, matching the behavior of
      Moose.
    - Classes without attributes used to store everything passed to ->new
      in the object.  This has been fixed to not store anything in the object,
      making it consistent with classes that had attributes.
    - Moo will now pass __no_BUILD__ to parent constructors when inheriting
      from a Moose or Class::Tiny class, to prevent them from calling BUILD
      functions.  Moo calls the BUILD functions itself, which previously led
      to them being called multiple times.
    - Attempting to replace an existing constructor, or modify one that has
      been used, will throw an error.  This includes adding attributes.
      Previously, this would result in some attributes being silently ignored
      by the constructor.
    - If a class's @ISA is modified without using 'extends' in a way that
      affects object construction, Moo will detect this and throw an error.
      This can happen in code that uses ->load_components from
      Class::C3::Componentised, which is common in DBIx::Class modules.

  * Bug Fixes
    - Fix calling class methods on Moo::HandleMoose::FakeMetaClass, such as
      modules scanning all classes

  * Miscellaneous
    - use Sub::Util instead of Sub::Name if available

1.007000 - 2015-01-21

  - clarify behavior of clearers for non-lazy attribute defaults
  - add Sub::Defer::undefer_package to undefer all subs from a given package
  - existing attributes will no longer be overwritten when composing roles.
    Previously, the attribute configuration used by the constructor would be
    overridden, but the attribute methods would not be.  This caused a mismatch
    in attribute behavior.

  - add attribute information to type check errors by trapping with an eval
    rather than overriding the global __DIE__ handler
  - bump Module::Runtime prerequisite to fix error messages when there is a
    missing module used by a role loaded using 'with' or similar (rt#97669)

1.005000 - 2014-06-10

  - fix repository links in pod
  - add missing changelog entry regarding strictures to 1.004000 release

1.004000 - 2013-12-26

0.009_015 - 2012-04-11
  - Complete support for MooseX::AttributeShortcuts 0.009
  - Allow Moo classes to compose Moose roles

  - Switch Moo::Utils to using Module::Runtime, and add the 5.8 %INC
    leakage fix into Role::Tiny's _load_module to provide partial parity
  - Update incompatibilities with Moose documentation
  - Remove Sub::Quote's outstanding queue since it doesn't actually slow
    things down to do it this way and makes debugging easier.
  - Revert 'local $@' around require calls to avoid triggering Unknown Error

  - remove the big scary warning because we seem to be mostly working now
  - perl based getter dies if @_ > 1 (XSAccessor already did)
  - add Role::Tiny::With for use in classes
  - automatically generate constructors in subclasses when required so that
    subclasses with a BUILD method but no attributes get it honoured
  - add coerce handling

0.009008 - 2011-06-03
