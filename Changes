Revision history for Moo

1.006000 - 2014-08-16
  - support coerce => 1 in attributes, taking the coercion from the isa option
    if it is an object that supports the coerce or coercion method.
  - add attribute information to type check errors by trapping with an eval
    rather than overriding the global __DIE__ handler
  - bump Module::Runtime prerequisite to fix error messages when there is a
    missing module used by a role loaded using 'with' or similar (rt#97669)

1.005000 - 2014-06-10
  - add qsub to Sub::Quote as a prototyped alternative to quote_sub, accepting
    only the sub body
  - avoid testing UTF-8 on perl 5.6

1.004006 - 2014-05-27
  - fix quotify for characters in the \x80-\xFF range when used under the utf8
    pragma.  Also fixes some cases of constructor generation with the pragma.

    for Moo constructors
  - don't build Moose metaclass when checking Moo classes with ->is_role
  - include Sub::Name in recommendations metadata

1.004_003 - 2014-04-13

  - fix Sub::Quote and Sub::Defer leaking memory
  - Class::XSAccessor is now listed as a recommended prerequisite
  - fix generating a subclass with roles when using a non-standard accessor
  - use alternate quoting routine, which is faster and saves memory by not
    loading B.pm

  - improved test coverage
  - fix strictures author test when PERL_STRICTURES_EXTRA is set
  - remove Dist::CheckConflicts prerequisite and replace with a test to report
    known broken downstream modules

1.004000 - 2013-12-26
  - strictures will now be applied to modules using Moo just as if they
    included "use strictures" directly.  This means that strictures extra
    checks will now apply to code in checkouts.
  - fix handling of type inflation when used with threads
  - don't include meta method when consuming Mouse roles
  - inhale Moose roles for has attr => ( handles => "RoleName" )

    init_arg => undef
  - document that BUILDARGS isn't called when there are no attributes
  - omit sub imported before use Moo from Moose method inflation
  - check for FOREIGNBUILDARGS only once per class instead of on each
    instantiation
  - take advantage of XS predicates from newer versions of Class::XSAccessor
  - always try to load superclasses and roles, and only fall back on the
    heuristic of checking for subs if the file doesn't exist
  - fix handling of attributes with names that aren't valid identifiers
  - Quoted subs now preserve the package and pragmas from their calling code
  - the official Moo git repository has moved to the Moose organization on
    GitHub: https://github.com/moose/Moo
